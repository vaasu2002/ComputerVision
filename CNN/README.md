### Kernels is a matrix and in CNN its used as weight/filter. 3x3 and 5x5 normal shape of filter. 1x1 is advanced. Convolution will reduce size of image matrix and keep value intact. We will keep on doing convulation until we get a minimal state.

OUTPUT IMAGE -> ``(n-f+1) * (n-f-1)``      **n --> size of image**,                           **f --> size of filter**
